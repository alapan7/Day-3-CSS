Mahendra Singh Dhoni or MS Dhoni is one of the best finishers in the game of cricket and one of the best captains for the Indian national team. <br> Dhoni took over the ODI captaincy from Rahul Dravid in 2007 after debuting in 2004. <br> He holds multiple captaincy records such as most wins for an Indian captain in Tests and ODIs, and most back-to-back wins by an Indian captain in ODIs. <br> His biggest triumphs as captain have been the 2007 World T20, 2010 Asia Cup, 2011 World Cup and 2013 Champions Trophy. <br> His heroic inning of 91 from 79 balls in the 2011 World Cup is one of his biggest highlights as a batsman and one which rose him to fame for his ability to stay cool under pressure thus earning him the moniker of 'Captain Cool'. <br> In the IPL, he's led Chennai Super Kings (CSK) to titles in 2010 and 2011.
